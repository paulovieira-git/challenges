user,Good morning. How can I make a tea?
assistant,"Good morning! Making tea is quite simple. Here's a basic guide:

1. Boil water: Fill a kettle with fresh cold water and bring it to a boil.

2. Choose your tea: Decide which type of tea you'd like to have. Common options include black tea, green tea, herbal tea, or flavored tea.

3. Prepare your teapot or cup: If using a teapot, warm it up by rinsing it with hot water. If using a cup, simply place a tea bag or loose tea leaves in it.

4. Add tea: If using tea bags, place one bag in your cup or teapot. If using loose tea leaves, add about one teaspoon per cup of tea.

5. Pour hot water: Once the water has boiled, pour it over the tea bag or leaves. Fill the cup or teapot, leaving some space for the tea to steep.

6. Steep the tea: Let the tea steep for the recommended time. This can vary depending on the type of tea you're using. Typically, black tea steeps for 3-5 minutes, green tea for 2-3 minutes, and herbal tea for 5-7 minutes. Follow the instructions on the tea packaging for best results.

7. Remove the tea bag or strain the leaves: Once the tea has steeped, remove the tea bag or strain the leaves from the teapot.

8. Enjoy your tea: You can drink the tea as is or add sweeteners, milk, or lemon according to your preference.

Remember to be cautious when handling hot water and always follow the instructions provided with your specific tea. Enjoy your cup of tea!"
